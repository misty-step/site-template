          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How often should I service my Audi or VW?</summary>
            <p class="mt-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm">Every 5,000 miles or 12 months, whichever comes first — though this varies by model and driving habits. Our team can advise based on your specific vehicle.</p>

          <details class="faq-item">

          </details>

            <p class="mt-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm">If it's solid, you can usually continue driving until we get you in. If it's flashing, stop as soon as it's safe and have the car towed — a flashing light signals a potentially serious problem.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
